    "I am a dedicated beginner backend developer with a passion for learning and building reliable, efficient systems. My experience so far has been focused on creating small-scale command-line programs using technologies like Java, JavaFX, Kotlin, and C#. These projects have provided me with a solid foundation in backend development principles and problem-solving.",
    "I am eager to expand my knowledge and take on more challenging projects while continuing to improve my skills. As I grow as a developer, I look forward to exploring how backend systems integrate with frontend interfaces to deliver complete and user-friendly applications.",
    "Currently, I am expanding my skill set by learning frontend development using HTML, CSS, React, Astro, Daisy UI, and Tailwind CSS. This journey enables me to better understand the complete stack, bridging the gap between backend and frontend for cohesive, user-focused solutions. I thrive in environments that challenge me to innovate and grow continuously.",
